# The-Euclidean-Algorithm-GCD


# Overview
This repository implements the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) algorithm, which calculates the largest integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. The algorithm is implemented using Euclidean Algorithm, which efficiently finds the GCD using recursion or iteration.

# Algorithm Explanation
The Euclidean Algorithm is based on the principle:

ðŸ“Œ GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A mod B)
ðŸ“Œ The algorithm continues until B becomes zero, at which point A is the GCD.

Steps:
Take two numbers A and B as input.

If B = 0, return A as the GCD.

Otherwise, compute A mod B and call the function recursively with (B, A mod B).

Repeat until B = 0.

Input: A = 56, B = 98
Step 1: 98 mod 56 = 42
Step 2: 56 mod 42 = 14
Step 3: 42 mod 14 = 0
Output: GCD = 14
# Applications
Used in cryptography (RSA algorithm).

Helps in reducing fractions to simplest form.

Foundational concept in number theory.
